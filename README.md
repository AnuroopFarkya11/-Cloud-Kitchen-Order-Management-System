# -Cloud-Kitchen-Order-Management-System
🍽️ Cloud Kitchen Order Management System - Spring Boot Challenge
Goal: Develop a robust, scalable backend system using Spring Boot (Java) to manage the entire lifecycle of an online food order for a cloud kitchen, from customer placement to final delivery and status tracking.

Key Requirements:

Order Management: Handle the creation, viewing, and updating of orders with real-time status changes.

Kitchen Workflow Automation (KDS Simulation): Implement the logic for the kitchen staff to update the order status (e.g., New, In Preparation, Ready for Pickup).

Real-time Customer Updates: Provide an endpoint for customers to get the live status of their order.

Delivery Integration: Simulate integration with a delivery partner system (e.g., assigning a rider).

User Roles: Implement basic role-based access control (RBAC) for Customer, KitchenStaff, and DeliveryPartner.
